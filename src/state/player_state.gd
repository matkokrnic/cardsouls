class_name PlayerState
extends RefCounted

## D1 per-player composite: hero + economy pools + deck + hand. Pure RefCounted. All pools
## share the match SignalQueue so their signals drain together after advance() (D5).

var hero: HeroState
var stamina: StaminaPool
var mana: ManaPool
var orbs: OrbPool          # reserved / flag-off until E5

## Story 3-3 (AC 1): the card containers, owned HERE (the pools' precedent) and filled at
## MatchState's single step-6 deal seat — never by this constructor, which has no content to
## fill them with (deck content reaches the state layer ONLY through MatchState's injection
## seam, AC 2). `hand` replaces the reserved plain Array E0 left as a placeholder; `deck` is
## new. Both hold StringName ids and nothing else. Neither takes the SignalQueue: no card
## signal ships in this story (AC 11).
var deck: Deck
var hand: Hand


## Story 3-1 (AC 1/AC 3): constructed STAT-LESS. Every bound below now arrives by injection
## (MatchState._apply_balance_to_player, from the single-source-of-truth BalanceConfig), so
## this constructor carries no tunable and there is no second seeding path that could
## disagree with the injected one. The leaf objects keep their own explicit-bounds
## constructors — they are containers, and their unit tests build them with real bounds —
## but the one production caller hands them zeros and lets injection do the rest.
