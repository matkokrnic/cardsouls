class_name MatchState
extends RefCounted

## D1/D2 root of the pure state layer. Owns the two PlayerStates, the reserved PitchState,
## the shared SignalQueue, and the single seeded gameplay RNG (F2). Pure RefCounted — no
## scene, no Input, no autoload, no wall-clock. The runner owns THIS object (no autoload
## for live state) and is the only thing that calls advance()/drain_signals().
##
## D2: advance(intents) is the ONE ordered call site that advances gameplay time. It only
## ENQUEUES signals; the runner drains them after it returns (D5).

## Owned by MatchState, relayed to the EventBus autoload by the runner (state never touches
## an autoload). loser_index: 0 = P1, 1 = P2.

## Injected via apply_balance() (story 1-1). `balance` holds the non-duration authored
## values; `balance_ticks` holds every `*_seconds` field pre-converted to integer ticks —
## the ONLY form in which those durations may be read inside advance() (A1).

## Per-slot camera basis (story 1-2) — an input-like PUSHED spatial fact, same category as
## InputIntent: the runner reads each rig and pushes it here in step 2. Fixed two-slot
## array, one per player — NEVER a single global basis (SEAM CHOICE 2: split-screen stays a
## config change). EXCLUDED from to_snapshot() like the intent stream; while the camera is
## fixed (all of E1) the basis is deterministic, so X5 replay is unaffected. Defaults to
## identity: with no basis pushed (tick 0, headless tests) move_dir is world-space (AC 4).
var _camera_bases: Array[Basis] = [Basis.IDENTITY, Basis.IDENTITY]


## E0 constructs both players symmetrically (mirror match). When BalanceConfig lands (E3)
## these values arrive from the injected config; they are never hardcoded in-place here.

## Runner step-2 push (story 1-2). slot: 0 = P1, 1 = P2 — out-of-range is a programming
## error (fixed-size fact; the array index asserts). State never reads the camera; it only
## receives this pushed value.
##
## LOAD-BEARING (DECISION A): while the camera is fixed (all of E1) the hero ROOT must
## never be rotated — body/facing rotation belongs on a child mesh node. The rig is a
## child of the hero root, so a rotated root would fold hero rotation into this pushed
## basis and break camera-relative "forward" (and the identity short-circuit in
## _resolve_movement). The runner therefore pushes the rig's LOCAL basis, guarded by
## test_root_rotation_isolation.gd; a story that needs a rotating root must decouple the
## rig from hero rotation deliberately (deferred DECISION B).
