## Story 4-1 (AC 7): the GREY-BOX UNIT -- the first real content in `src/actors/minions/`, the
## directory `docs/game-architecture.md`'s Directory Tree tags `(4-1)` and which held nothing but
## a `.gitkeep` until this story.
##
## A PLACEHOLDER MESH AND NOTHING ELSE. Visual fidelity is explicitly out of scope everywhere in
## this project and grey-box is the standing bar; this exists so a resolved `summon_*` cast has a
## visible, persistent consequence a human can see in the live smoke, which is the story's whole
## player-facing claim.
##
## NO GAMEPLAY LOGIC LIVES HERE, on the HeroActor / TelegraphController precedent and the
## project-context HARD RULE that puts it there: no `_physics_process` (INVARIANT F1 -- the runner
## owns the only one), no `Input`, no state handle, no signal into state, no damage, no targeting,
## no AI. It is placed by the runner and it stands there. Movement and AI are 4-2's; HP, damage and
## death are 4-3's; totem-vs-minion differentiation is 4-4's.
##
## POSITION IS ACTOR-OWNED, WHICH IS THE RULING (`4-1/R12`), NOT A CONVENIENCE. UnitBoard holds no
## position and the hero precedent is unchanged (hero_state.gd:5 -- "no position (position is
## actor-owned, F1)"). The runner chooses where a unit stands, exactly as it reads
## `actor.global_position` off the hero and pushes only a DERIVED fact inward. `4-2`'s gate rules
## on real position ownership once TargetingService exists as a consumer.
##
## POOLED BY NOBODY THIS STORY (4-5). Units are plain instantiated and `queue_free()`d nodes here;
## 4-5's tier is assigned at this story's close-out.
